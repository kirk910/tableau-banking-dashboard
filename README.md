# Tableau Banking Dashboard – Customer Risk & Profitability Insights

This project uses Tableau to analyse banking customer data and deliver
actionable insights on credit risk, customer loyalty, and profitability.
The dashboard supports business decision-making by identifying high-risk
segments, loyal high-value customers, and opportunities for targeted rewards
and retention strategies.

Developed as part of an academic assignment, the project demonstrates
analytical thinking, business context understanding, and data storytelling.
